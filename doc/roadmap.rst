Roadmap
=======

I want Déjà Fu to be the best it can possibly be.  Success can be
measured in a few different ways: functionality, performance,
correctness.  These are all important, but very different, areas to
improve.  This roadmap highlights what I think are the priorities in
those three areas.

* Atomic state invariants (:issue:`177`)
* Check DPOR invariants at construction time (:issue:`173`)
* Crosscheck GHC RTS behavior with dejafu (:issue:`163`)
* Maximal Causality Reduction (MCR) algorithm (:issue:`154`)
* Add optional length bounding to uniform & weighted testing (:issue:`119`)
* Doctest all Haddock code examples (:issue:`86`)

You can also check the :github:`roadmap <labels/roadmap>` tag on the
issue tracker.
