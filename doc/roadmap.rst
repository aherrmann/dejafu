Roadmap
=======

I want Déjà Fu to be the best it can possibly be.  Success can be
measured in a few different ways: functionality, performance,
correctness.  These are all important, but very different, areas to
improve.  This roadmap highlights what I think are the priorities in
those three areas.

* Atomic state invariants (`#177`_)
* Check DPOR invariants at construction time (`#173`_)
* Crosscheck GHC RTS behavior with dejafu (`#163`_)
* Maximal Causality Reduction (MCR) algorithm (`#154`_)
* Add optional length bounding to uniform & weighted testing (`#119`_)
* Doctest all Haddock code examples (`#86`_)
